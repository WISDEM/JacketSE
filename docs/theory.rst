The jacket component (class) can be used to model a wind turbine jacket-tower configuration.   
Three and four-legged jackets can be devised. The lattice is composed of main legs, X-braces, optional horizontal braces at the bottom and at the top, 
and a simplified frame at the top to simulate the transition piece.
More details for the code can be found in :cite:`damiani13`.
Theory for the finite element code is available at `Frame3DD <http://frame3dd.sourceforge.net/>`_.
